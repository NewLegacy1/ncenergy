      "We have been involved with the family of Northern Clean Energy folks for 7 plus years and report as follows. To know them is to love them! Courteous, factual, punctual, tidy and honest. They run their business like I run mine and they are a highly regarded resource for input into both my business and personal heating, air-conditioning and \"green\" initiative planning. I enjoy the many exchanges with Justin as we are past the basics and I enjoy \"the facts\" attitude. Certainly, they work in our best interest always!",

She can already feel a big improvement in their comfort and air quality. She is passing along my card to her daughter and will recommend us whenever she can. Thanks so much for a great job, please pass it along to Keith!",

      "As a property manager for approximately 40 rental units for the last few years, I have used the services of Rob Ronnenberg and his team at Northern Clean Energy on many occasions including for older, unusual heating systems. They are always knowledgeable, professional and consistently provide excellent, prompt service. When my own furnace was abruptly red-tagged by the utility company, that company was ready to send out their salespeople. I declined, saying that I already had a trusted HVAC company. (It turns out the utility technician knew Rob and confirmed I was in good hands). Rob and his team were at my house at 9 a.m the very next morning and had a new furnace, A/C and humidifier installed by mid-afternoon. The only evidence that they had been there at all was the shiny new equipment. There was no garbage or mess left behind. Every member of the team was friendly and professional. I highly recommend this company!",

      "As a new business owner during a particularly difficult time (thank you, COVID), it was great to have fast service not to mention an extremely gracious response to inquiries regarding billing. Trevor was approachable, understanding and willing to problem solve our billing issue and offer service options for the future. He was a pleasure to speak with. Great customer service.",

      "Justin and his team were fantastic to deal with. I had to get 2 lines installed for my stove and dryer and I will definitely be giving them a Shout when I need to get a new HVAC system installed. It's a great comfort to find a reliable, professional and trustworthy trade to work with. Thank you again guys!",
